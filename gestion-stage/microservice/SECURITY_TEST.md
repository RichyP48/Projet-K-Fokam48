# üîí Security Test - Company Application Isolation

## Problem Fixed
**Issue**: Companies could see candidatures from other companies by accessing unsecured endpoints.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Endpoint Authorization Checks**
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidatures/offre/{id}` - Now requires company ownership verification
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidatures/{id}` - Now requires user authorization (student or company)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidatures/etudiant/{id}` - Now requires student or teacher authorization
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidatures/entreprise/{id}` - Now requires company ownership verification
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidatures/{id}/cv` - Now requires authorization to download CVs

### 2. **Authorization Methods Added**
- `isCompanyAuthorizedForApplication()` - Verifies company owns the offer
- `isUserAuthorizedForOffer()` - Verifies user can access offer applications
- `isUserAuthorizedForApplication()` - Verifies user can view specific application
- `isTeacherAuthorizedForStudent()` - Placeholder for teacher-student relationships
- `validateCompanyAccess()` - Service layer validation
- `validateOfferAccess()` - Service layer validation

### 3. **Security Logging**
- All authorization attempts are logged with üîí emoji
- Security violations are logged with üö® emoji
- Detailed logging for audit trails

## Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ **Scenario 1: Company A tries to access Company B's applications**
```bash
# Company A (ID: 1) tries to access Company B (ID: 2) applications
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <company_a_token>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/entreprise/2
# Expected: 403 FORBIDDEN
```

### ‚úÖ **Scenario 2: Company tries to access offer they don't own**
```bash
# Company A tries to access applications for Company B's offer
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <company_a_token>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/offre/12
# Expected: 403 FORBIDDEN (if offer 12 belongs to Company B)
```

### ‚úÖ **Scenario 3: User tries to access application they don't own**
```bash
# User tries to access someone else's application
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/123
# Expected: 403 FORBIDDEN (unless user is student or company owner)
```

### ‚úÖ **Scenario 4: Unauthorized CV download attempt**
```bash
# User tries to download CV for application they can't access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <unauthorized_token>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/123/cv
# Expected: 403 FORBIDDEN
```

## Verification Commands

### 1. **Test Company Isolation**
```bash
# Test endpoint that shows isolation is working
curl http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/debug/isolation-test
```

### 2. **Health Check with Security Status**
```bash
# Check service health and security status
curl http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/health
```

### 3. **Test Authorization for Specific Company**
```bash
# Test authorization for company 1
curl http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/debug/direct-test/1

# Test authorization for company 2  
curl http://localhost:8082/api/candidatures/debug/direct-test/2
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of authorization checks
3. **Fail Secure**: Default to deny access when authorization fails
4. **Audit Logging**: All access attempts are logged for security monitoring
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing

## Next Steps for Enhanced Security

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
2. **Add Rate Limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Implement Teacher-Student Relationships** in user-service
4. **Add API Key Authentication** for service-to-service calls
5. **Implement Data Encryption** for sensitive information
6. **Add Security Headers** (CORS, CSP, etc.)

## Monitoring & Alerts

Watch for these log patterns that indicate security violations:
- `üö® SECURITY VIOLATION:` - Unauthorized access attempts
- `‚ùå Authorization check failed` - System errors during authorization
- Multiple failed authorization attempts from same user/IP

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Create test data** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   # Create offers for different companies
   # Create applications for those offers
   ```

3. **Test with different user tokens**:
   - Company A token should only see Company A applications
   - Company B token should only see Company B applications
   - Student token should only see their own applications

4. **Verify logs** show proper authorization checks and any violations

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Company A cannot see Company B's applications**
‚úÖ **All endpoints require proper authorization**
‚úÖ **Security violations are logged and blocked**
‚úÖ **Legitimate access still works correctly**
‚úÖ **No data leakage between companies**
